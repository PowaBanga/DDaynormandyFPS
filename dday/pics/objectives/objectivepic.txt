This file will teach you how to create the picture that displays the objectives for your map.

Creating the "objective pic" is quite simple. To make the pic you can use the file ddaytemplate.pcx (located in the dday/pics/objectives folder) or create your own image.
Just make sure that your image is no larger than 256 x 256 pixels and it is in the q2 pallete.

If you choose to use the ddaytemplate.pcx file, load it up in your paint program and simply use your text tool to insert your own objectives text.  I used the font arial in size 10.  You can also create your own unique objective pic.

Once you have created the picture, save the file as the name of your map.  For instance, if your map name is mymap.bsp, save your pic as mymap.pcx.  Also, make sure you save it to your dday/pic/objectives directory.

That's it.  Nice and simple.  If you have any additional comments or questions email Castrator@planetquake.com
