;Custom flood protection mod commands.
;
;This lists all the extra mod commands that can be monitored under
;the standard flood protection / mute rules.
;
;The file q2adminflood.txt is read from the quake2 directory and the mod 
;directory.  This allows server admin's to setup custom flood commands as 
;global and mod specific as well.
;
;The format for q2adminflood.txt is as follows:
;
;Lines beginning with a ';' are comments.
;
;flood command format:
;<floodtype><command to check>
;
; <floodtype> can be one of three values:
; 'EX:'  Exact match.
; 'SW:'  Starts with match.
; 'RE:'  Regular Expression match. 
;
;e.g.
;SW:play_
;EX:wfplay
;RE:^say.*
;
; The matchs are only made against the first word or the command 
; e.g. in the command "play_person cl 0 xxx" only "play_person" is 
; checked against the flood command list
;
; NOTE: DO NOT PUT THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS INTO THIS FILE:
; say, say_team, say_group, say_person or any added mod command
; that generates normal message text.
;
; You can monitor q2admin own commands like:
; play_person, play_team
;
; Also note that internal commands to quake2 can't be monitored as
; mod's don't see these client commands. e.g. name, cl_maxfps, rate, etc 
;
;There is a limit of 1024 custom flood commands that can be setup.
