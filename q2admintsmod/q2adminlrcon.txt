;Limited rcon is for admin's that have to give out rcon to clan's for 
;compotations but don't really want to. 
;
;What the server admin can do is setup a limited rcon which only allows
;commands that the admin has setup to be allowed to run.
;
;The file q2adminlrcon.txt is read from the quake2 directory and the mod 
;directory.  This allows server admin's to setup lrcon's as global and 
;mod specific as well.
;
;The format for q2adminlrcon.txt is as follows:
;
;Lines beginning with a ';' are comments.
;
;lrcon command format:
;<lrcontype><password> <command to allow>
;
; <lrcontype> can be one of three values:
; 'SW:'  Starts with match.
; 'EX:'  Exact match.
; 'RE:'  Regular Expression match. 
;
;e.g.
;SW:secret map
;SW:secret timelimit
;SW:secret fraglimit
;EX:top fraglimit 100
;EX:top fraglimit 50
;RE:tip ^map q2dm[1258]$
;
;You can even specify extact commands that are allowed e.g. say you want 
;lrcon password 'duck' only to be able to change maps to q2dm1, q2dm2 and
;q2dm8.  The q2adminlrcon.txt would look like:
;
;EX:duck map q2dm1
;EX:duck map q2dm2
;EX:duck map q2dm8
;
; or use a regular expression like this:
;RE:duck ^map q2dm[128]$
;
;To run lrcon from the client console is the same as running rcon.
;e.g.
;
;lrcon duck map q2dm1
;
;or
;
;lrcon secret timelimit 40
;
;
;There is a limit of 1024 lrcon password commands that can be setup.
;
;The only prereqesit for running lrcon is that the quake2 server 
;rcon_password must be set to *SOMETHING*. It doesn't matter what 
;but something so that normal rcon works.
;
;Also if the client has rcon_password set lrcon will not work.
;Note: there is no lrcon_password, so the password must be typed all 
;the time.
